Basically, when I navigate to a non-existent URL, the 'not-found.js' UI is not shown (even though the URL has already updated in the browser). To make it show, I need to refresh the page manually.

Also, once I got to the 'not-found.js' UI, when I hit the browsers back button, the URL updates to the previous URL but the UI stays the same, at 'not-found.js'. I need to refresh the page to make the UI match with the URL.

I believe this is not the intended behavior of the 'not-found.js' right? The way I understand it is that it should act pretty much like a 404.html file.
